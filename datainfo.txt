Some notes about how Picasso stores its data: 

Picasso stores much of its data as hdf5 files, which contain a structure of named groups and datasets.
The format of picasso data seems to be as one big dataset. Individual rows correspond to (groups of) events. 

A complete column listing is given for pick properties data:

...group 1
   n_events 2
   frame_mean 3
   frame_std 4
   x_mean 5
   x_std 6
   y_mean 7
   y_std 8
   photons_mean 9
   photons_std 10
   sx_mean 11
   sx_std 12
   sy_mean 13
   sy_std 14
   bg_mean 15
   bg_std 16
   lpx_mean 17
   lpx_std 18
   lpy_mean 19
   lpy_std 20
   ellipticity_mean 21
   ellipticity_std 22
   net_gradient_mean 23
   net_gradient_std 24
   group_mean 25
   group_std 26
   len_mean 27
   len_std 28
   n_mean 29
   n_std 30
   photon_rate_mean 31
