Description: # m_curate
        Curate contains a few basic tools for working with data from Picasso. Specifically, it can read localisation and pick properties data. 
        I will also include some example scripts to demonstrate usage of data extraction and then very basically how one might visualise the data.
        
        ## Installation:
        Either add m_curate.py to your python path or import manually.
        
        ## Operating instructions:
        See source code for some insight into what inputs each function takes. If this code set becomes large enough (or becomes used by persons other than myself), I'll consider proper documentation.

        This is currently WIP.
